SELECT patient_id,attending_doctor_id,diagnosis
FROM admissions
WHERE (patient_id % 2 != 0  AND   attending_doctor_id IN (1,5,19))

FROM patients p 
JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
JOIN doctors d ON a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id

---- 23) display the number of duplicate patients based on their first_name and last_name.
SELECT first_name,last_name,count(*) AS num_of_duplication
